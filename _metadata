  "description" : "[h1]Thedoorguy's GiC Enhanced Storage Patch[/h1]\nSmall patch to enable Enhanced Storage functionality and increase slot count of most Galaxy in Conflict storage containers.\n\nMade this because I wanted a bigger ship locker for the 4 playable races, and couldn't find a patch in the workshop. Whilst it's been fine in gameplay, I haven't tested in full. Bug reports are welcome. \n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] make a backup of your player and universe folders before trying this, installing the mod should have no problems, but always backup just in case. Uninstalling will have the same consequences as uninstalling any other Enhanced Storage patch, or uninstalling Enhanced Storage itself.\n\n[h1]Requires[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2754886445]Galaxy in Conflict[/url]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731220462]Enhanced Storage[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Recommended[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3176034032]Galaxy in Conflict - Spawnable Items Pack Patch[/url] (easier way of obtaining furniture for builds until there are furniture stores)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Features[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Increases ship locker slot count to same size (100) as other races' if you're using Enhanced Storage already\n[*]Increases GiC furniture storage\n[*]Full changes in change notes\n[/list]\n\n[b]Note:[/b] liquid containers (gas can, gas drum, IBC tanks), component cases, and some medical containers aren't supported yet.
